LuaVMTool
=========
This is an attempt at a Lua-controlled version of VMware's vmrun utility.

It could be extended to work with VirtualBox as well if I were to abstract the VMInterface into an actual interface and attach it to appropriate functionality.

You will need a copy of the VMware VIX SDK installed to compile this tool.
